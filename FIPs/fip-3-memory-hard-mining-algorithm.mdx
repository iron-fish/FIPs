## Abstract

This proposes changing the Iron Fish hashing algorithm to a memory hard Proof of Work algorithm similar to 
[Ethash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining-algorithms/ethash/). 
The algorithm levels the playing field between different mining hardware (ASICS, FPGAs and GPUs) to make mining more 
accessible to a wider range of community members.

## Motivation

During the first days of the Iron Fish mainnet, it was observed that there was a high percentage of blocks of unknown origin. 
This unknown hashrate was unaffected by price changes compared to hashrate from GPU mining. This led the community to 
believe that this hash rate had a not inconsiderable economic advantage over GPU miners and that it could be coming 
from FPGAs or some other form of ASIC hardware.

In a voting that ended on October 3rd 2023 the mining community of Iron Fish opted to change the proof of work scheme (PoW) 
used in the project to a proposal made by Lolliedieb on September 18th which was eventually named FishHash. The goal behind 
the process was to democratizing the mining of Iron Fish. For most blockchain projects, a large number of miners in the 
initial mining community is beneficial because it increases the total number of people who interact with the project and increases community engagement.

The technical goal of FishHash is to be memory bandwidth bound as opposed to the current compute-bound blake3 algorithm. 
Memory chip hardware is all very similar in performance and characteristics, since memory cells are already extremely optimized 
to record data as reliably and quickly as possible. For this reason, the memory used in 
different device categories such as graphics cards (GPU), field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and application-specific integrated 
circuit (ASIC) are all very similar and have only minor differences in their performance.

Therefore, the idea is to create a PoW scheme that is mainly based on the existence and performance of these memory chips, 
so that the performance and efficiency difference between specialized and widely available hardware is as small as possible. 
This specification describes the basic structure of this new scheme and which steps are necessary to compute a correct hash value with the new scheme.

## Specification

#### Algorithm Outline
The basic concept of most memory-hard algorithms is based on three processing phases that will be
executed in order (depicted below).

![Algorithm 1](/images/fip-3/algorithm-1.png)

This scheme is quite commonly used by multiple PoW algorithms such as Ethash, Etchash, KawPow,
Octopus or with slightly modified Autolykos just to name a few. To create a secure PoW scheme, 
one always relies on established hash functions for computing the initial seed and the final result.
The further properties like the memory size requirement enforce a minimum device specs required
to run the PoW scheme. For PoW schemes that are memory limited, which is when the central loop of 
operation dominates the overall run time of the algorithm, the performance that can be achieved on
the algorithm is determined by the `ReadDataset` portion of the loop. So the total access increases with and the
number of loop iterations. In order to obtain an algorithm limited by memory bandwidth, it is important that the amount of
memory segments requested in the central loop is large in relation to the hash function used as well
as the overhead of the mix function.

Beside memory size requirement, for many miners properties like the power draw are important. This property mostly
depends on the locality of the data set, e.g. if it can be fully cached or if the device memory must be
active during the mining process. It also depends on the ratio between the core dependent operations like the
`HashFunction` and the `MixFunction` and the memory access call.

#### Hash Functions and Expanding

The hash function used for the FishHash PoW scheme is defined to be the Blake3 algorithm. We chose
this algorithm because it is optimized to run on native 32 bit hardware as many GPUs are. Also its
rounds are rather lightweight compared to other hash functions. Due to the IronFish block header
having a size of 180 bytes the first iteration will require three rounds of Blake3, while the final hash call
processing the 64 bytes of StartValue plus 32 bytes of `MixValue` needs to run two such iterations.
The output of a Blake3 hash function call has up to 64 bytes. The `MixValue` used for our proof of
work scheme will be 128 bytes. In order to pad the output of the initial call to this length the 64
output bytes will be duplicated. As for the final Blake3 call we will ask for a 32 Byte output of the
hash function. This equals the output length the Blake3 function has when mining IronFish before
the fork.
Therefore the inputs and outputs of FishHash as a whole equal the usage of Blake3 function for
computing the block header hash value before the fork to FishHash and the new scheme can be used
as a drop in replacement.

#### Fetching and Mixing Values

The FishHash algorithm will always fetch three values of 128 bytes width and also aligned by 128 bytes
from the data set to be processed into a new mixing value. This access size is wide enough to utilize
the memory bandwidth a typical consumer GPU offers by always filling full cache lines.
In order to fetch three different values of pseudo random position in every pass of the central loop,
we will take different disjoint sections of the `MixValue` and perform a modular reduction modulo the
number of items in the data set. In order to reduce the overhead we decided to use constant positions 
in the data set, which makes getting the reduced value easier than for example Ethash. The three positions
will be offset by 32 bytes in between. This ensures that in case of multiple threads working on the same
`MixHash` the calculation the address calculation can be spread and performed by different threads in
parallel.
Let for Var[a : b] denote the bytes with index a ≤ b of Var be read as an integer value of length
b − a + 1 in little endian encoding. Also let `DataSet[n]` denote the nth 128 byte wide entry of the
pre-calculated data set. Then the function `ReadDataSet` for FishHash is defined like follows.

![Algorithm 2](/images/fip-3/algorithm-2.png)

For mixing the fetched data with the `MixValue` we decided to first modify two of the three fetched
values in different manners with the existing `MixValue`. This ensures that the old value in its full
length is relevant for the next generated iteration of `MixValue`. This also ensures that it is relevant
if a fetched value is in first, second or third position. Afterwards we interpret the 128 bytes values as
16 integers of 64 bit or 8 bytes each and perform a single multiply and add operation on each of them
to generate a new `MixValue`.

![Algorithm 3](/images/fip-3/algorithm-3.png)

We define that in the description of algorithm 4 the symbol ⊕ denotes a logical bitwise xor, the function
`FNV` is identical to the function of the same name known from the Ethash PoW, namely `FNV(a, b)`
is defined to be (0x01000193 · a) ⊕ b. Because this function is working on 32 bit values we define this
function to operate on all 32 dword sized chunks of `LoadValue[128 : 255]` and `MixValue`. Note that
the two operations of the loop usually can be performed as a single multiply and add operation on
most architectures, but for format reasons we decided to note them down as two separated operations.

#### Collapsing the Final Value
The 128 bytes output of the `MixValue` variable will be collapsed down to a value of length 32 bytes
to reduce the computation demand of the final call to the Blake3 hash function. In order to make
all bytes of `MixValue` important this can not happen by a simple truncation, but instead we use the
same reduction function based on the above mentioned `FNV` function that is common to most Ethash
siblings.

![Algorithm 4](/images/fip-3/algorithm-4.png)

#### Data Set Generation and Parameters
Different to siblings of Ethash the data set size in FishHash is a constant value and equals 4608 MBytes
or exactly 37748717 data set elements, which equals the figures for Ethash epoch 448.

The algorithm for creating the dag is almost identical to the one for creating an Ethash DAG for epoch 448,
but with two central changes. First of all the seed to generate the light cache is the 32 byte
value received by

$$
Blake3("FishHash") = Blake3(0x4669736848617368)
= 0xeb0163aef2ab1c5a66310c1c14d60f4255a9b39b0edf26539844f117ad672119
$$

Secondly the iterations used for calculating a dag item is doubled from the original value of 256 to
512. Otherwise the generation of the data set remains identical to the Ethash algorithm, because the
general approach has proven itself to be free of any backdoor reducing the calculation effort over the
past years.

#### Static Analysis: Memory Demand
As mentioned in the previous section the memory size required to mine equals 4608 MBytes. On top of
this most implementations will allocate additional 72 MBytes to fit the light cache. These 72 MBytes
are also required for a light verify that is exists mostly for verifying blocks, but not mining computed hashes.
Note that implementation dependent these 72 MBytes are optional once the data set has been build
and the space can be used for other operations afterwards. Also it is possible to keep the light cache off
device and just build the dag at an lower speed in case there is shortage of memory on the device itself.
With this storage requirements the algorithm can be performed on all GPUs with at least 5 GByte
released during the past 6 years as well as the specialized GPUs with 5 GBytes. In case of GPUs
equiped with 6 GBytes this should be feasible independent of the operating system and independently
of a screen to be connected or not.

Once the minimum memory capacity requirement is met, the actual performance of the algorithm
depends on the memory bandwidth of the memory. With the access width of 128 sequential and
aligned bytes for each access, the memory accesses are identically wide as, for example, with the
Ethash algorithm, where over 90% of the theoretically available memory bandwidth can also be used
practically on all modern architectures. In each iteration of the main loop there are three such accesses. Furthermore, there are a total of 32
iterations of the main loop, so that the memory bandwidth requirement for each calculated hash value
is 12288 bytes. This is 50% higher than with Ethash and it can be assumed that, unless there are
other reasons to the contrary, the maximum performance of the mining process is about 2/3 of the
performance of mining Ethash on the same hardware given the same settings.

#### Static Analysis: Computational Demand

The computational demand of calculating a single hash value is highly dependent on the actual ar-
chitecture of the device the PoW scheme is supposed to be run on. For the sake of simplicity we will
assume that we have an underlying architecure that is able to process one 32 bit integer or logical
operation at a time. Note that the actual clock cycles used on modern architectures will be less,
because most architectures offer specialized instructions that can perform multiple operations in one
instruction.

For the central loop of the algorithm calculating the three addresses takes less then 10 clock cycles
each. This includes the operations required to perform a Barret reduction on the 32 bit value that
needs to be reduced mod the data set size and to shift it to actually generate a valid memory address
from it. The application of the FNV function and the ⊕ operation on the fetched values will take 64
and 32 operations. With regard to the two 64 bit operations we can assume, that a 64 bit multiply
can be emulated with five 32 bit operations on a 32 bit architecture and the 64 bit addition can be
emulated with two 32 bit additions with carry over. Therefore the total amount of operations can be
upper bound by 16 · (5 + 2) = 112 instructions.
Overall the central loop can be estimated to take less then 32 · (30 + 64 + 32 + 112) = 7616 32-bit
operations. Additionally there are the currently required three blake3 loop iterations per calculated hash. 
Each of them taking 12 · 8 calls to the Blake3 g-function, which consists of 14 operations with
32 bit values. Therefore the calculation of the needed Blake3 hashes will add about 3 · 7 · 8 · 14 = 2352
additional operations.
Note that with this figures the computational demand is relatively small compared with the memory
demand, because already the latency for fetching uncached data from the data set will span multiple
hundreds of clock cycles. Also the numbers presented per hash here are significantly less then e.g. for
the Ethash algorithm, because alone the 24 iterations of the twice performed keccak algorithm need
to be estimated with 250 cycles for each iteration or over 12000 operations in total using the same
assumptions as for our algorithm.
Therefore comparing with other algorithms using a similar structure the computational demand of
the algorithm is rather small and we can assume that on modern architectures the assumption to
be memory bandwidth bound holds. This also applies for other device classes as FPGAs or ASICs,
that should be capable of performing the algorithm once the minimum criteria of enough memory size
is met, but the advantage they can gain over common hardware as GPUs is limited to improve the
computational side of the algorithm, which is not performance critical. This limitation of potential
performance and efficiency gains is what makes FishHash a GPU friendly algorithm in the end.

## Rationale

During the voting process many other ASIC resistant algorithm were considered. Although the primary reason for 
choosing FishHash was the result of the votes of the mining community, there are underlying reasons why these 
alternatives may not be as suitable.

#### Ethash
[Ethash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining-algorithms/ethash/) was the Ethereum PoW 
mining algorithm before ETH switched over to PoS in Sept 2022. It was created with the goal of being a memory hard ASIC 
resistant algorithm and achieved that goal through much of ETH’s history. Towards the end of ETH’s PoW Bitmain and a few other 
ASIC companies introduced ASICs for the Ethash algorithm. Although not incredibly faster than GPUs in terms of hashrate, 
these ASICS were much more efficient (2-10x) in terms of power consumption. The existence of these ASICS is the main reason 
to not transition to Ethash as the mining algorithm.

#### Ethash w/ EIP 3372
[EIP-3372](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3372) is an ETH Improvement Proposal that recognized the introduction of 
ASICS onto the ETH network and proposed a small change to Ethash in order to invalidate currently available ASICS. The change 
was never adopted by ETH and the network eventually transitioned to PoS. This proposal is very similar to FishHash and could be 
a viable alternative but was not chosen in the voting over a custom mining algorithm for Iron Fish.

#### Autolykos V2
[Autolykos](https://storage.googleapis.com/ergo-cms-media/docs/ErgoPow.pdf) was designed for the Ergo network in 2019. 
It’s based on the [Equihash](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316904748_Equihash_Asymmetric_Proof-of-Work_Based_on_the_Generalized_Birthday_Problem) 
mining algorithm (ZCash’s current algorithm). Autolykos is another memory hard hashing algorithm designed to be ASIC resistant.

Autolykos is currently viewed as successful accomplishing this ASIC resistance as there are no known ASICS on the 
Ergo platform. However, due to the relatively small market cap of ERG compared to ETH the incentive for ASICS has 
not been as prominent as for Ethash. The main reason voters did not want to go with Autolykos is most likely to 
not intertwine the fate of ASICS on Iron Fish ASICS on Ergo.

#### ProgPoW
[ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW) is a mining algorithm originally designed for Ethereum as a 
replacement for Ethash. When Bitmain’s Antminer E3 for Ethash was released, it became clear that optimized 
hardware for Ethash existed prompting some community members to look for a replacement solution optimized for GPU miners specifically.

ProgPoW being optimized for GPUs is designed to use the entire GPU core. This means that the algorithm puts 
much more load on a GPU than other hashing algorithms. Because of this, ProgPoW can produce high temperatures 
and energy usage on GPUs. This is the main reason some mining community members did not like this approach.

#### EthashB3
[EthashB3](https://github.com/Rethereum-blockchain/ethashb3) is a variant of Ethash proposed by the Retheruem 
project. Instead of using the keccak hashing function internally it uses Blake3. The variant does change the 
algorithm slightly to be potentially resistant to existing Ethash ASICS but it is also possible that existing 
ASICS for Ethash could be re-used for EthashB3. EthashB3 has not been used for very long on an established 
network so it is difficult to determine the viability of existing ASICS being re-used for this algorithm.

## Backwards Compatibility 

Changing the hashing algorithm of Iron Fish will result in a hardfork of the chain and thus will not be 
backwards compatible with previous versions of the node. Individual account balances will not be affected 
by the change. **[TODO: Add FIP for Hardfork\]**

## Security and Privacy Considerations
#### Cryptographic Security Concerns
The main security concerns that were considered in this proposal are

- The new hashing algorithm could be vulnerable to known cryptographic attacks like pre-image or collision attacks.

- The hashing algorithm still has optimizations that can be exploited by specialized hardware to gain an advatage in mining

Both of these concerns are partially mitigated by the fact that FishHash shares many similarities with Ethash. 
The memory cache expansion piece for example is identical. Ethash was used on Ethereum mainnet for many years 
and so has a certain confirmed level of security through usage. Additionally Iron Fish has commissioned an 
official audit of the cryptographic security of the new algorithm from security firm Trail of Bits. **[TODO: Add Audit\]**. 
Supplementing this official audit many community members with a vested stake in the network have reviewed the 
FishHash code which is [open source](https://github.com/iron-fish/fish-hash). This includes mining software developers, miners and mining pools.

#### Network Transition Concerns
Another more logistical security concern is that switching over to a new mining algorithm could result in a temporary flux in the network difficulty. 
If done incorrectly this could result in a temporary halt in the network. Another FIP has been created to address this issue. **[TODO: Add FIP for Difficulty\]**

In addition to the potential network halt, the change in difficulty opens up re-org attack oppourtunities for bad actors. Imagine the following situation:

1. FishHash activates at block 100
1. 100 FishHash blocks are mined at much lower total difficulty than blake3 blocks
1. The total difficulty of the longest chain is now 100b + 100f, b being the average
blake3 difficulty and f being the average FishHash difficulty
1. A bad actor re-mines a blake3 block 100 at a higher difficulty such that the difficulty
different between block 100 and block 100' is greater than 100f. This is possible because the FishHash
average difficulty is much lower than the blake3 average difficulty
1. The bad actor can create a large re-org with very little hashpower

The plan to mitigate this attack is 2-fold
1. Implement re-org limits (discussed further in this FIP **[TODO: Add FIP for re-org\]**)
1. Recommend users not send transactions during the transition period as re-orgs are still possible
