## Abstract
This FIP specifies the dates and changes for the first Iron Fish Hardfork. The hardfork will include
- Switching the mining algorithm to FishHash from Blake3 (FIP-3)
- Swap positions of randomenss and graffiti fields in header serialization (FIP-9)
- Enforce that a blocks timestamp is strictly greater than the previous block (FIP-2)
- Add mechanism for faster difficulty adjustment per block as well as a one time difficulty adjustment to account for the change in mining algorithm (FIP-8)

## Motivation

This hardfork is neccesary to implement the changes in the referenced FIPs. For motivation on the individual changes, refer to the individual FIPs.

## Specification
- Activation:
    - Block >= 419_193 on the Iron Fish [Testnet](https://testnet.explorer.ironfish.network/), estimated February 28 2024 17:00 GMT
    - Block >= 503_338 on the Iron Fish [Mainnet](https://explorer.ironfish.network/), estimated April 2 2024 13:00 GMT

- Included FIPs:
    - [FIP-2](/fips/fip-2-enforce-sequential-block-time) Enforce Sequential Block Time
    - [FIP-3](/fips/fip-3-memory-hard-mining-algorithm) FishHash Memory Hard Mining Algorithm
    - [FIP-8](/fips/fip-8-difficulty-adjustment) Difficulty Adjustment
    - [FIP-9](/fips/fip-9-swap-randomness-and-graffiti) Swap Randomness and Graffiti Header Positions

## Backwards CompatibilityÂ 

This hardfork will not be backwards compatible. All nodes and miners will need to upgrade to the hardfork version of Iron Fish.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

Read more in deatil in the individual FIPs.

## Reference Implementation

[Version 2.0](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/releases/tag/v2.0.0) of the Iron Fish node includes the changes specified in this FIP.
